      "answer": "DIRECT ANSWER: The expected YoY revenue growth for Tesla in Q4 2025 is -3.1%.\n\nSYNTHESIS: Both the bullish and bearish analyses agree that Tesla is currently experiencing a -3.1% YoY revenue decline. The bullish perspective highlights Tesla's strong free cash flow and market leadership in emerging technologies as reasons for potential future growth despite the current revenue decline. It suggests that Tesla's current stock price, which is above the 200-day moving average, indicates underlying strength and potential for recovery. On the other hand, the bearish view emphasizes the negative revenue growth and high valuation metrics as signs of overvaluation, which could pose risks if the company does not meet growth expectations. The high beta indicates significant volatility, and the stock's recent price decline from its 52-week high suggests potential further downside. Overall, the analyses present a mixed outlook with significant risks and potential rewards.",

The bullish view highlights Apple's strong fundamentals, revenue growth, and substantial free cash flow, suggesting potential upside. Conversely, the bearish view points to overvaluation concerns and recent negative momentum, as the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and has declined from its 52-week high.
