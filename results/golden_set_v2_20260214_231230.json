      "answer": "DIRECT ANSWER: The expected YoY revenue growth for Tesla in Q4 2025 is not explicitly provided, but the current revenue growth is noted as -3.1%.\n\nSYNTHESIS: The bullish perspective highlights Tesla's strong fundamentals, operational efficiency, and potential for growth through its Gigafactory expansion and new technologies. Despite the negative revenue growth, the company is seen as having significant upside potential due to its market leadership and innovation. The bearish view points to the negative revenue growth as a major concern, indicating contraction and potential overvaluation, with technical indicators suggesting weakening momentum. Without specific forward guidance, there is a risk of continued revenue weakness in Q4 2025.",
